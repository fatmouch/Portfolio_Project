this repositery is shwonig my final project of foundations in my ALX journey 

*****My To-Do List Application*****


_Project Description_


This is a simple and user-friendly To-Do List application that allows users to add, complete, delete tasks, and experience a daily reset for task management. The app also includes light and dark modes for a more personalized experience. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and stores tasks in localStorage so that users can revisit their task list even after refreshing the page.

_Features_


Add and Delete Tasks: 
Users can easily add new tasks and remove completed or unnecessary tasks.
Task Completion:
Mark tasks as complete with a single click.
Daily Reset: 
Tasks reset every day while preserving information from the previous day.
Light/Dark Mode Toggle:
Users can switch between light and dark themes for better accessibility.
Responsive Design: 
The app is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
Technologies Used
HTML5: 
For structuring the content of the app.
CSS3: 
For styling and creating a responsive layout.
JavaScript: 
For dynamic functionalities such as task management and localStorage integration.
FontAwesome: 
For icons used in the user interface.
localStorage: 
To store tasks and theme preferences so they persist even after page reloads.

Challenges Faced
Task Deletion: 
Implementing a delete button for each task required figuring out how to dynamically remove elements and update localStorage.
Daily Reset: 
It was challenging to implement the logic that ensures tasks reset daily while retaining the previous day’s data.
Lessons Learned
Breaking down complex functionality into smaller tasks made the development process smoother.
Learned how to manage state using localStorage and ensure data persists between browser sessions.
***Future Improvements**


Add functionality for users to prioritize tasks (e.g., high/medium/low priority).

Implement task categories or tags for better organization.

Sync tasks across devices using a backend service.
